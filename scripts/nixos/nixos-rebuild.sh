# I believe there are a few ways to do this:
#
#    1. My current way, using a minimal /etc/nixos/configuration.nix that just imports my config from my home directory (see it in the gist)
#    https://gist.github.com/0atman/1a5133b842f929ba4c1e195ee67599d5
#    2. Symlinking to your own configuration.nix in your home directory (I think I tried and abandoned this and links made relative paths weird)
#    3. My new favourite way: as @clot27 says, you can provide nixos-rebuild with a path to the config, allowing it to be entirely inside your dotfies, with zero bootstrapping of files required.
#       `nixos-rebuild switch -I nixos-config=path/to/configuration.nix`
#    4. If you uses a flake as your primary config, you can specify a path to `configuration.nix` in it and then `nixos-rebuild switch —flake` path/to/directory
# As I hope was clear from the video, I am new to nixos, and there may be other, better, options, in which case I'd love to know them! (I'll update the gist if so)

# A rebuild script that commits on a successful build
set -e

# Edit your config
$EDITOR configuration.nix

# cd to your config dir
pushd ~/dotfiles/nixos/

# Early return if no changes were detected (thanks @singiamtel!)
if git diff --quiet '*.nix'; then
    echo "No changes detected, exiting."
    popd
    exit 0
